# ComTools

## Background

ComTools is a pipeline that focued on analysis about comparative genomics. In this view, it is aimed to deal with data generated by whole genome alignment (by lastz, or lastal and cactus).

##  Main Usage

1. Merging blocks, operating sequecing and filter.

2. Extract or remove assigned features from Maf format file (CDS, gene, mRNA or others).

3. Split alignment in small windows.

4. Construct phylogenetic tree using different model.

5. Estimate convegent sites thourgh alignment results.

## Denpendencies

Perl, version > 5.32.1

##  Preparing Input Files

First we need a MAF format alignment file. you can generate it using lastz, lastal or cactus (cactus recommanded).

For lastal, you could read my previous published pipeline (https://github.com/gotouerina/Comparative-genomics-script/wiki/03.LASTAL-Alignment-Pipeline). 

For lastz, please check the manual.

For cactus, you should follow the instruction of official manual, and extract Maf format file from HAL format file using cactus-hal2maf 

Parameters, for example, "--refGenome $YourRefGenome --chunkSize 500000  --dupeMode single --noAncestors"

## Filter the MAF format file
