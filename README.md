# ComTools

# Background

ComTools is a pipeline that focued on analysis about comparative genomics. In this view, it is aimed to deal with data generated by whole genome alignment (by lastz, or lastal and cactus).

#  Main Usage

1. Merging blocks, operating sequecing and filter.

2. Extract or remove assigned features from Maf format file (CDS, gene, mRNA or others).

3. Split alignment in small windows.

4. Construct phylogenetic tree using different model.

5. Estimate convegent sites thourgh alignment results.
